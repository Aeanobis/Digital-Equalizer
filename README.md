HOW TO USE GRAPHIC EQUALIZER:

0)Open the EqualizerUpdated427.m file and press F5 or hit the run button on the top.

1)Load the .wav file you want to alter (If you just want a frequency response of the filter and do not want to alter any song, do not load a file).
Note:Make sure the .wav file is in the same directory as the .m file of the equalizer.

2)Set the sliders to the desired level for each frequency. (setting it below zero will cut the frequency, above zero will gain, and keeping it at zero will not change it).

4)Enjoy listening if you want to try different settings hit the stop button and change the sliders as needed then click play. (You do not need to hit stop if you have not loaded a file).
